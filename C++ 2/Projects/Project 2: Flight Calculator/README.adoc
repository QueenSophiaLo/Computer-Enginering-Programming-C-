= Overview

This Flight Calculator computes the amount of time it takes an airplane to fly from one GPS location to another of the user's chosing. 

== Description

This program begins by requesting the user to choose a GPS location from an enumerated list of options presented in coordinates of latitude and longitude (similar to the format below)

    Miami Beach, FL, USA    25.793449    -80.139198
    Fargo, ND, USA    46.877186    -96.789803
    Idaho City, ID     43.828850    -115.837860
    ... 

More lat/long GPS locations can be found link:https://www.latlong.net/category/cities-236-15.html.adoc[here^].

The program will then prompt the user to select a departure location by entering in the enumerated value associated with the desired location. The same list will be presented again with the exclusion of the previously selected location to allow the user to select a destination.

Once the user has selected both a departure and a destination location, the distance to both locations will be computed. This distance cannot be computed using typical Euclidean distance between two points, as we are dealing with points on the surface of a sphere. Flight calculation requires use of the Haversine formula to calculate distance across the surface of the sphere. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula.adoc[The Haversine formula^] appears as follows:

where:

    φ1, φ2 are the latitude of point 1 and latitude of point 2,
    λ1, λ2 are the longitude of point 1 and longitude of point 2.
    r is the radius of the sphere
    d is the distance between the two points

The radius of the earth is approximately 3,958.8 mi.

Once the distance between two points has been computed, the average flight time is calculated based off a general plane speed of 525 mph (the average passenger jet flies at a speed of somewhere between around 460-575 mph).

== Notes and Tips

   * When encountering a list of related items, all with a name, latitude, and longitude values, 
    it may be useful to use multiple arrays or vectors to handle this. So, consider making a separate
    array for names, latitude values, and longitude values, but keep all the data unified over a
    single index. For example, index 0 will contain "Miami" in the names list, "25.793449" in the
    latitude list, and "-80.139198" in the longitude list. (There are much better ways to handle
    this, but you will learn about that later in this course)
   * You might not have heard of a "magic number" yet, but we will discuss them in class. For a great
    explanation on what they are and how to deal with them in C++, check out this    link:https://dev.to/10xlearner/magic-numbers-and-how-to-deal-with-them-in-c-2jbn.adoc[article^]
